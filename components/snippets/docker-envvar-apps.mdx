## Controlling container services
When the environment variable `GROWCHIEF_APPS` is not set, or is set to an empty string, all
services will be started in a single container. This is normally fine for small, personal deployments.

However, you can only start specific services within the docker container by changing this environement variable.

If you need to scale, you can experiement with having multiple containers defined like;
- Frontend only: `GROWCHIEF_APPS="frontend"`
- Backend only: `GROWCHIEF_APPS="backend"`
- Worker and Cron only: `GROWCHIEF_APPS="worker cron"`
