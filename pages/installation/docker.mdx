# Set environment variables

GrowChief configuration is entirely via environment variables for now. You might be used to setting environment variables when starting containers,
however growchief needs a LOT of environment variables, so setting these on command line or in a docker-compose is probably not practical for long
term maintainability.

It is recommended to use a `.env` file, which the GrowChief containers look for in /config. Docker will automatically create this file for you on a
docker volume the first time you start up GrowChief.

The default .env file can be found here; [example .env file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gitroomhq/growchief-app/main/.env.example)

## Create the container

This example below shows how to create the GrowChief container on the command line.

Note that you will need to replace the `./config` with the path to your config directory. You will also need Postgres and Redis running.

```bash
docker create --name growchief -v growchief-uploads:/uploads/ -v growchief-config:/config/ -p 5000:5000 ghcr.io/gitroomhq/growchief-app:latest
```
