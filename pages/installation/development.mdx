This is currently the recommended option to install GrowChief in a supportable configuration. The docker images are in active and heavy development for now.

## Tested configurations

- MacOS
- Linux (Fedora 40)

Naturally you can use these instructions to setup a development environment on any platform, but there may not be much experience in the community to help you with any issues you may encounter.

### Warning about Windows

Several users using Windows (and WSL) have reported issues with the setup. This is not well tested as the main developers of the project do not use Windows/WSL for development. If you are using Windows and encounter issues, please do not try to get support, as we aren't able to support you.

<Prereqs />

### Prerequisite Local Services

- **Node.js** - for running the code! (version 18+)
- **PostgreSQL** - or any other SQL database (instructions below suggest Docker)
- **Redis** - for handling worker queues (instructions below suggest Docker)

We have some messages from users who are using Windows, which should work, but they are not tested well yet.

## Installation Instructions

### NodeJS (version 18+)

A complete guide of how to install NodeJS can be found [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

### PostgreSQL (or any other SQL database) & Redis

You can choose **Option A** to **Option B** to install the database.

#### Option A) Postgres and Redis as Single containers

You can install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and run:

```bash Terminal
docker run -e POSTGRES_USER=root -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_password --name postgres -p 5432:5432 -d postgres
docker run --name redis -p 6379:6379 -d redis
```

#### Option B) Postgres and Redis as docker-compose

Download the [docker-compose.yaml file here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gitroomhq/growchief-app/main/docker-compose.dev.yaml),
or grab it from the repository in the next step.

```bash Terminal
docker compose -f "docker-compose.dev.yaml" up
```
