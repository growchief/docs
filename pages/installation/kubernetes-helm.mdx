## The Helm Chart
GrowChief has a helm chart that is in very active development. You can find it here;

Note that this is a OCI compliant helm chart, meaning that you don't do `helm repo add`, and if you are using Flux or Helm, you must set them to OCI mode.

https://github.com/gitroomhq/growchief-helmchart

The `values.yml` file can be found in the repository, or a direct link to it is: https://github.com/gitroomhq/growchief-helmchart/blob/main/charts/growchief/values.yaml
