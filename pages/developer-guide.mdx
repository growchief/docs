## Understand how to develop with GrowChief

## How to setup your development environment

This page explains [How to setup your development environment](./installation/development).

## Architecture Overview

Before getting started with development, have a good read of the [architecture overview](./howitworks.mdx). This will give you a good understanding of how the project is structured and how the different parts of the project interact with each other.

## Repository Overview

GrowChief is an open-source project, and the source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/gitroomhq/growchief-app).

The project is generally built using scripts in the `package.json` file with npm. The main scripts are:

* `npm run dev` - Starts the development server
* `npm run prisma-generate` - Generates the Prisma client
* `npm run prisma-db-push` - Pushes the database schema to the database

The entire project is built under [NX](https://nx.dev/) to have a monorepo with multiple projects.<br /><br />
Unlike other NX project, this project has one `.env` file that is shared between all the apps.<br />
It makes it easier to develop and deploy the project.

### Frontend

The frontend is built with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

### Backend

The backend is built with [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) with a basic architecture of controllers, services, repositories and dtos.<br /><br />
It uses [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) as an ORM to interact with the database.<br />
By default Prisma uses [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) as a database, but it can be easily changed to any other database since there are no native queries.<br /><br />
It uses Redis to schedule posts and run background jobs.

### Cron

cron is built with [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) and share components with the backend.

### Worker

worker is built with [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) and share components with the backend.
